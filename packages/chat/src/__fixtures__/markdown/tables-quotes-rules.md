# Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

| First Header | Second Header |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell | Content Cell  |

| Command    | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| git status | List all new or modified files                 |
| git diff   | Show file differences that haven't been staged |

| Command      | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `git status` | List all _new or modified_ files                   |
| `git diff`   | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| git status   |   git status   |    git status |
| git diff     |    git diff    |      git diff |

| Name     | Character |
| -------- | --------- |
| Backtick | `         |
| Pipe     | \|        |

# Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.
> Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.
> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>
> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...
> >
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.
